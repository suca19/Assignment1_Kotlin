## Review

The purpose of this project is to show what i learnt from my mobile apps course, this is the first project of many :)

on the main class you will have four functions where each one will display a different page of the project.

we have four pages: 2 for login and 2 for sign up => gray Login, Sign Up and black Login, Sign Up.

gLogin, bLogin, gSignUp, bSignUp: These functions define different layouts for login and signup screens.
They use Jetpack Compose components like Surface, Column, Text, Image, Button, and TextField to create UI elements.
